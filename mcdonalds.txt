Clean restaurant with clean restrooms and excellent service. The manager made a special effort of getting our special order just right. The breakfast sandwiches were fresh and delicious.

It was fantastic, the staff made sure to smell my food before giving it to me.. it was the best service I could ever ask for and for bonus points the McDonald's had a pickle stench everywhere.. the best smell on earth I tell you..

I've been here about four times in the last month. This is probably the best McDonald's I have visited from a product quality and service standpoint. I have probably been to fifty different McDonald's in California over the years. Please keep up the good work.

Unless you drive through expect to be ignored and extremely slow service. And never a clean table. Totally ridiculous

Service badly needs improvement. Drive thru is the worst. The person who took the order is monosyllabic and the person who gave the order messed up my order that I end up going inside. Only to find out there were 2 more people from the drive thru who had their order messed up as well.

Service was disappointing. Shut the window immediately and I was not able to request my coffee they forgot to give me. It was cheap anyways so I just left and let it go but still, not great.
