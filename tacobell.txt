just moved to the area & decided to get some tacos after moving all day, the food was hot, tasty and fresh. teresa took my order and had such amazing customer service. i will definitely be a regular!

The facility is clean and well maintained. The employees are generally polite and helpful. There are occasionally long wait times for the food, but I've noticed that the food quality is much better than other taco bells in the area. I believe they are also open quite late, which is helpful since there aren't a lot of late night food places in the area.

Beautiful Taco Bell! Friendly and fast service and great food. Food is always fresh and team is always welcoming. Great neighborhood TacoBell!

A lot of unfortunate situations happened during our visit. There were just a lot of mishaps that I think can easily be improved on.

Food for the most part is fine. The temperature inside is also set on freeze so guess they really don't want you staying.
